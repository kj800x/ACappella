Kevin's Django A Cappella Site
========
This site was developed to serve as a tool for a cappella groups. Arrangers would be able to create a cappella groups and add their singers to them. Then arrangers could upload mono tracks containing just one voice part each. Singers could then go and design a custom mix (pan and volume) of the learning tracks (ex: bass and percussion panned left, solo centered, other parts panned right). Arrangers could also upload PDFs of the songs, and singers could download copies whenever they needed them. The idea was that the site would be the go-to place for the a cappella group.

The idea didn't catch on with the group I was in, so I ceased development, but I still think it could be a viable idea for me to revisit sometime.
