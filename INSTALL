DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
=====

Install:
==
1) Clone the current version of this software from github.com/robodoggy/ACapella
2) Make sure you have Python 2.7 (apt-get install python), Django (pip install django), and python-mysqldb (apt-get install python-mysqldb).
3) Change acapellasite/settings.py and make sure that it points to a valid mysql server (or change it to a mysqlite server). At this point you might want to just double check all the settings.
