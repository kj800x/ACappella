  Finish up INSTALL
  Reenable Effects on the Song-Mixdown page

  Make it so that the filename creator checks for any obvious focuses, Ex: there is only the Bass on the left channel, so call it "TooClose-BassMix"
    Otherwise call it a generic "TooClose-Mixdown"
  When Implimenting Upload, make it call sox and have it merge to 1 channel. Sox gets grumpy later on if this isn't done
